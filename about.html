       <p>
        ...is a student at San Jose State University currently working towards a Bachelors of Fine Arts in Digital Media Art. 
        He is trying to pursue a career as a type of artist though is still unsure as to the path he’ll be following. 
        As a fan of video games such Minecraft, Horizon video game series, and retro gaming, he would enjoy the path pointing more so towards them. 
        He aims to develop his skills in digital drawing, 3d modeling, and coding. 
        As he also has experience filming, editing and pencil-to-paper drawing, he has a large collection of tools at his disposal.

        <h3> <b> So here's my story... </b></h3> 
          
        <p style = "text-indent: 20px;">

          When it comes to making art, I have started with simple shapes and just tried to make them more of what they are. 
          For example, I like to draw(pencil-to-paper) technical cubic 3D shapes. One of my favorites pieces looks as if it is a rubik’s cube but each of its 27 cube pieces are hollowed out. 
          It is a very geometric, methodical drawing that takes time and focus. I’ve created variations of it over the years but they all follow the same repetitive pattern and story.
        </p> 
        <p style = "text-indent: 20px;"> 
          I have been told it would be easier to draw my technical cubes digitally but that would be too easy. 
          My whole purpose in drawing these technically precise designs and shapes by hand is a discipline and principal practice. 
          I like to show what I can produce with only a simple pencil and paper. I’ve demonstrated in my art that if I focus on a specific practice, 
          I can push its limits and transition something simple to something really technically sound with just the single medium.
        </p> 
        <p style = "text-indent: 20px;"> 
          When it comes to my art, I enjoy just zoning out, being in my own zen and just producing something. 
          There are some things that are just for me and that can lead to some pieces I feel more personally attached to. Because of this, more of a part of me is left in my art. 
          Not all art needs meaning. Some are just me wanting to put me on the page. I like to show people a part of myself and let them see the artist beyond the work. 
          Not everyone sees your art as you do. 
          But if they do, cool. They can see a part of you others don't.</p> 
        <p style = "text-indent: 20px;"> 
          A huge inspiration to me in creating digital art has been video games. 
          They’ve promoted a lot of what I do today in a lot of my art. 
          Game models are instrumental in character design. 
          From the Minecraft creatures to the machine titans in the Horizon video game series, 
          these have promoted both low and high poly character design and both create thriving environments that I would want to be involved in.</p> 
        <p style = "text-indent: 20px;"> 
          Whether it is including a small reference in the back, a character in prominent view, or pulling specific colors and themes from them, 
          video games have stood out as part of my digital art design concepts. 
          I’ve created animations, videos, graphics, and models all having a connection to videogames. 
          It has become an identifiable part of my digital art career and I do wish to follow through with it in the future. </p> 
        <p style = "text-indent: 20px;"> 
          I have set a goal for myself of having made a small video game within the next two years. 
          My coding skills have recently leveled up and it is now another tool to add to my belt. 
          I have all of these skills and they have all been disconnected previously. 
          But having a localized goal for myself and targeting my mass of tools and skills towards it gives me the opportunity and drive to push my skills further to create more elaborate art than I’ve done previously.</p>

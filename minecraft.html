          <h3> <b>Minecraft Tutorial</b></h3> 
            
          <p>

I made a Minecraft tutorial video teaching how to beat the base game. I am very familiar with the game so making a video about it seemed easy. 
Yes, it was fun to just play the game but the purpose of it was to create the video itself.
So while playing, I had to recognize and think as though I had an actual camera in hand.
I needed to visually portray things in such a way as if I was writing a script at the same time of 'filming'. 
Even though certain mechanics of the game were easy to me, 
as a tutorial, I needed to do things in their simplest form and recognize my audience as 'I'm filming'.
I had 3 hours of footage to condense and make digestable to a viewer.
I had to convey the key points of the video across while my narration was in pace with the visual.
I couldn't make the video only me talking. Nor could I let the video stand alone. 
This was also a short adventure into the idea of storytelling. 
By holding attention and having a series of events diced into what could be described as chapters, you can have a beginning, a middle and an end.
